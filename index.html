           <h2>What To Do When You're At Home:</h2>
      <p>Being home alone is the most common way to get bored. You've got no one to talk to, and (if you're on here) nothing to do. But hopefully this list will change that!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="Indoor-List">
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>Try Learning A New Language! </p></b>
     <p>Learning a new language isn't easy, but it is a nice way to keep youreslf occupied, and could prove useful in the future. Try using an app to get started such as <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> or <a href="https://www.rosettastone.com/buy/special-offer-199/?msclkid=365cfdec9cdf10ecbb729b75bef4af54&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand%20-%20Canada%20-%20Exact&utm_term=rosetta%20stone&utm_content=General%20-%20Rosetta%20Stone">Rossetta Stone</a>.</p>
       <li><p><b>Go On An Online Shopping Spree!</p></b>
        <p>If, like me, you don't enjoy getting out of the house to <i>shop</i>, but you know you need to, get online! You have something to do, and you get everything you need all from the comfort of your home. So it's definitely a great way to make use of your extra time!</p>
        <li><p><b>Play A Video Game!</p></b>
        <p>Downloading and playing a new video game, or just play one of your favorites is a great way to pass the time, especially if you've tried all else. The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-CA/switch/">Nintendo Switch</a> is easily a great recomendation, since you can play multiple different games on it, but <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-ca/xbox-game-pass?ef_id=_k_be264ed281141f282d0a284bb7c48912_k_&OCID=AIDcmmrlps7tn2_SEM__k_be264ed281141f282d0a284bb7c48912_k_&msclkid=be264ed281141f282d0a284bb7c48912">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=en-US">Fortnite</a> are great options too!</p>
        <li><p><b>Watch a movie!</p></b>
        <p>Imagine watching a moive at home, with a bowl of popcorn and soda, possibly in a nice cozy blanket on your couch, with the lights turned off. Movies are a great form of entertainment, and will certainly lift your bored spirits.</p>
        <li><p><b>Meditate</p></b>
        <p>Meditating might <i>sound</i> boring, but it helps to get you calmed down and maybe afterwards you'll be able to think of something to do yourself!</p>
        <li><p><b>Organize Something</p></b>
        <p>Organizing things usually clears a lot of people's minds, so clean your room, rearrange your clothing in color order, create a playlist of your favorite songs.</p>
        <li><p><b>Learn an instrument!</p></b>
        Music is said to be nectar to the soul. But you don't just have to listen to it, you could play it too. Picking up an instrument is not only a great skill to have, but also full of benefits. It helps you memorize things quicker and work much better in a team, so why not start now?</p>
      <li><p><b>Read!</p></b>
      <p>Reading is a great way to indulge yourself. Try reading something other than your usual genre, as that can always be insightful.</p>
      <li><p><b>Enroll In A New Class!</p></b>
      <p>Picking up a new skill isn't a bad idea. Enrolling in a new class might be the best way to connect with other people and make new friends.</p>
      <li><p><b>Bake Something Sweet</p></b>
      <p>Whenever most people crave a sweet treat, they head to the bakery. You don't have to do that, you can bake your own. Baking something usually makes most people delighted, and it never fails to disapoint with something to eat afterwards!</p>
